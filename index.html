KINGS COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH COURT
FORENSIC PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATION
JAMAL ALAUR

Shlomit Levy, LCSW
Project/Clinical Director
Brooklyn Mental Health Court
320 Jay Street, Room 14.66
Brooklyn, NY 11021

Date of Report: December 15, 2025
Date of Exam: November 18, 2025

INTRODUCTION

I, Francheska Bidot Rodriguez, PhD, performed a psychological and psychiatric examination of Mr. Jamal Alaur in order to answer the following questions:

Does Mr. Alaur suffer from any mental disease or defect that might have contributed to his offense conduct?
Can Mr. Alaur be safely maintained in the community with an appropriate treatment plan?
What are his current treatment needs, taking into account the criminogenic factors identified?
Is Mr. Alaur willing and motivated to engage in appropriate treatment?

Mr. Alaur is currently charged with six counts of burglary in the third degree, six counts of petit larceny, six counts of criminal possession of stolen property in the fifth degree, and other related charges stemming from several incidents that allegedly occurred from November 29, 2022, to February 15, 2023.

Mr. Alaur is currently detained at Rikers Island. I evaluated Mr. Alaur via a secure video conferencing platform. The limits of confidentiality inherent to this examination were explained to Mr. Alaur. He demonstrated an adequate understanding of these concepts and consented to participate.

I reviewed the following sources of information:
Criminal Complaint, The People of the State of New York v. Jamal Alaur, dated February 16, 2023
Fingerprint Response Summary, dated February 17, 2023
Brooklyn Mental Health Court Referral Sheet, dated April 17, 2025
Brooklyn Mental Health Court Psychosocial Interview, authored by Tigan Kessler, LCSW, dated October 3, 2025
Medical records from NYC Health + Hospitals/Correctional Health Services, dated March 26, 2025, to October 7, 2025

RELEVANT HISTORY

Mr. Jamal Alaur is a 37-year-old Arabic man, born on January 6, 1988, in Brooklyn, NY. He was raised by both parents alongside three brothers and a sister, in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. Mr. Alaur denied any history of developmental delays, childhood abuse, or trauma. He additionally reported no family history of mental illness or substance use. Mr. Alaur reported maintaining positive familial relationships at present. He indicated that his needs were met throughout his upbringing. He reported that he is currently single and denied having any children. Prior to his arrest, Mr. Alaur was residing with his family, denying a history of homelessness. Of note, records indicate that Mr. Alaur has a history of homelessness.

Regarding educational attainment, Mr. Alaur reportedly obtained his General Equivalency Diploma in 2009. He denied a history of special education services or learning disabilities. Mr. Alaur denied a history of expulsions or behavioral problems; however, he acknowledged one suspension in junior high school for fighting. Mr. Alaur reported a history of employment as a bread delivery boy and a warehouse worker. His longest employment was as a delivery boy for approximately four years. His last employment was as a warehouse worker from 2019 to 2022.

Medically speaking, Mr. Alaur denied a history of chronic medical issues, head injuries resulting in loss of consciousness or cognitive sequelae, seizures, and surgeries. He reported a history of two hospitalizations for stomach pain.

Mr. Alaur denied current use of substances. He reported a history of polysubstance use including cannabis, cocaine, and heroin. Mr. Alaur disclosed daily use of cannabis and heroin, and occasional use of cocaine. His medical records additionally note a history of opioid use, benzodiazepines, unspecified anxiolytics, unspecified amphetamines, and unspecified hypnotics. He reported previous treatment for a month at a rehabilitation facility. Mr. Alaur tested positive for heroin during his intake at Rikers Island and has been receiving methadone treatment.

Mr. Alaur denied a history of psychiatric hospitalizations or mental health treatment, including psychotropic medication. He reported that his first encounter with such medication was upon intake at Rikers Island. His current treatment involves Haldol and two other medications he could not name; according to records, the other two medications are Remeron and Cogentin. Regarding psychiatric symptomology, he reported sleep disturbances, racing thoughts, feelings of nervousness/uneasiness, and shaking. Mr. Alaur denied knowledge of any current diagnosis. Of note, during a recent psychosocial interview, he disclosed previously being diagnosed with schizophrenia, two hospitalizations due to yelling on the street, and identified auditory hallucinations as his primary symptom.

Mr. Alaur reported a history of over 90 arrests outside of his arrest for the instant offense. He denied culpability for his legal involvement. Mr. Alaur's Fingerprint Response Summary indicated that he has a total of 41 arrests for various charges including petit larceny, criminal possession of stolen property, and criminal possession of controlled substances.

REVIEW OF AVAILABLE PSYCHIATRIC RECORDS

Despite Mr. Alaur's denial of a mental health history, a review of available records reveals he began exhibiting psychotic symptoms in 2002 and has a significant history of receiving services for both psychiatric and substance-related difficulties. Since 2015, he had over three dozen emergency department visits and hospitalizations related to substance use and overdoses. He has additionally received substance use treatment on numerous occasions. Previous psychiatric diagnoses have included delusional disorder, schizophrenia, and adjustment disorder. When in periods of decompensation, he presents with anxiety, depression, auditory hallucinations, delusional thought content, insomnia, a decreased appetite, and psychomotor agitation.

Records show that on April 27, 2024, Mr. Alaur admitted to experiencing suicidal ideation and intended to tie a bedsheet around his neck. He was placed on suicide watch for three days. After being adjudicated as an incapacitated person pursuant to CPL 730, Mr. Alaur was admitted to Mid-Hudson Forensic Psychotherapy Center on November 12, 2024, for competency restoration treatment. During this hospitalization, he was demonstrating delusional thought content. Treatment over objection was granted on December 12, 2024, allowing a transition in treatment from olanzapine to Haldol injections, which successfully stabilized Mr. Alaur's clinical presentation. He was discharged with a diagnosis of schizophrenia and a medication regimen including Haldol Decanoate, Cogentin, Benadryl, and Remeron and transferred back to Rikers Island on March 26, 2025.

THE INSTANT OFFENSE

According to the Criminal Complaint, on six separate occasions from November 29, 2022, to February 15, 2023, Mr. Alaur allegedly trespassed business premises, in violation of an order of protection signed on November 11, 2022. It is alleged that during the first, fifth, and sixth events, Mr. Alaur entered the premises to steal two packs of beer each time. During the second and third instant, he allegedly stole laundry detergent, and on the fourth instant he allegedly stole deodorant.

Mr. Alaur reported an understanding that accepting a guilty plea is required to participate in mental health court; however, he denied all his current charges. When presented with details about the alleged instant offenses, he denied the events entirely.

MENTAL STATUS EXAMINATION

Mr. Jamal Alaur is a 37-year-old Arabic man who appeared his stated age. He was dressed in jail-issued attire, had dark outgrown hair, and appeared adequately groomed. He presented with persistent rocking restlessness. Mr. Alaur was alert and fully oriented to time, person, and place. He was cooperative with the evaluation and engaged appropriately. He was able to provide a coherent biographic narrative; however, due to discrepancies between his self-report and medical records, he impressed as an unreliable historian. His speech was fluent and normal for rate, rhythm, and volume. His thought processes were linear, organized, and coherent. Mr. Alaur did not break focus in ways consistent with internal preoccupation. He denied experiencing auditory and visual hallucinations. Mr. Alaur's mood was euthymic and his affect was congruent with his mood and in full range. He denied current suicidal ideation, intent, or behavior.

Mr. Alaur expressed poor insight into his psychiatric illness and need for treatment. He demonstrated poor understanding of his charges, the legal proceedings in which he is involved, and the nature and rules of the Mental Health Court.

RISK ASSESSMENT

A risk assessment is a comprehensive analysis of an individual's potential for future violent behavior. Although it is impossible to predict whether someone will be violent at any given moment, this analysis stratifies the risk of dangerousness into low, medium, and high. It provides a general assessment of the individual's potential for future violence by analyzing a number of significant factors that have been associated with violent behavior.

Mr. Alaur presents with the following aggravating factors for dangerousness:
History of severe mental illness
History of substance use
Extensive history of criminal justice involvement
History of homelessness
Lack of stable employment

Mitigating factors reducing the risk for violence include:
Familial support
Interest in mental health treatment
Current medication compliance and consequent resolve of psychiatric symptoms
Current abstinence from substances

DIAGNOSIS AND FORMULATION

Mr. Alaur underwent a psychological examination to assess his eligibility for diversion into the Brooklyn Mental Health Court. As a result of this psychological examination and review of available collateral data, I have come to the following diagnostic categorization, as defined by the DSM-5-TR:

Schizophrenia, multiple episodes, in partial remission
Unspecified Opioid-Related Disorder
Unspecified Cannabis-Related Disorder
Unspecified Stimulant-Related Disorder

While he denied any history of psychiatric symptoms during the present evaluation, Mr. Alaur meets the DSM-5-TR criteria for schizophrenia, multiple episodes, in partial remission. Collateral records indicate Mr. Alaur has exhibited symptoms of psychosis since at least 2002. His current medication regimen has successfully reduced Mr. Alaur's overt psychotic symptoms.

Given the severity of his mental illness, its direct relationship to the offense conduct, and his expressed motivation for treatment, it is my opinion that Mr. Alaur is a good candidate for diversion into the Mental Health Court.

Brooklyn, NY 11021

Date of Report: October 2, 2025
Date of Exam: September 23, 2025

INTRODUCTION

I, Dr. LaShonda T. Green, performed a psychiatric examination of Mr. Kareem Gaines in order to answer the following questions:

Does Mr. Gaines suffer from any mental disease or defect that might have contributed to his offense conduct?
Is Mr. Gaines a candidate for diversion into Brooklyn Mental Health Court?
Does Mr. Gaines pose any threat or danger to the community as a result of a mental disease or defect?
What are his current treatment needs taking into account the criminogenic factors identified?

The case was discussed with Dr. Alexander Bardey. Mr. Gaines is currently charged with two counts of criminal contempt in the second degree stemming from an incident that allegedly occurred on or about May 19, 2025.

The following documents were reviewed as part of the evaluation:
Criminal Complaint of the City of New York, County of Kings, dated May 22, 2025
New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services, Additional Fingerprint Response, dated May 19, 2025
Psychosocial Interview, authored by Nancy Frost, LCSW, dated September 2, 2025

PAST PERSONAL HISTORY

Mr. Gaines is an unmarried, 41-year-old, Black American male was born in Brooklyn, and raised primarily by his mother in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood. His father resided in the home during his upbringing but moved out when Mr. Gaines was approximately 21-22 years old. Mr. Gaines reported having one sister, age 43, with whom he maintains consistent contact. He denied any major difficulties during childhood, including abuse, neglect, or placement in foster care, and reported that his basic needs were consistently met.

Mr. Gaines reported earning his high school diploma from Procter High School in upstate New York in 1999. Prior to this, he attended Job Corps in 1998 as a barber's apprentice. He denied truancy, suspensions, or expulsions, though acknowledged involvement in three to four physical fights during school.

Occupationally, he reported working for Lion Security from approximately ages 18 to 23. He later worked at a cellphone store in a maintenance role for about three years but left due to inadequate pay.

Mr. Gaines is currently out on bail. He reported an estimated nine prior arrests, primarily related to warrants, failures to appear, and minor offenses. He is currently residing at the Bedford Atlantic Men's Shelter in Brooklyn. He reported a history of homelessness.

Mr. Gaines reported having two children, a 13-year-old son and a 9-year-old son. He described himself as "a good father." He described his mother, sister, and paternal uncle as his most important supports.

Mr. Gaines reported initiating marijuana use at approximately age 17 and described a past cannabis habit, which he stated he quit three years ago. He denied use of other illicit substances.

Mr. Gaines reported a psychiatric history significant for a diagnosis of schizophrenia at approximately age 16. He denied paranoia, hallucinations, or other psychotic features. He denied psychiatric hospitalizations but reported beginning outpatient psychiatric treatment at Kings County Hospital the week prior to the evaluation. He stated that he has been prescribed Depakote and Risperdal. He also reported being prescribed Invega Sustenna more recently.

THE INSTANT OFFENSE

Regarding the instant offense, Mr. Gaines reported that the incident occurred at his grandmother's residence, where he was not permitted to stay. He described a verbal argument in May 2025 after his grandmother requested that he return to the shelter. He acknowledged that he was cursing at her in a loud voice but denied making threats or engaging in any property destruction.

According to the Criminal Complaint, Police Officer Aleksandra W. Chorazewicz alleged that on May 19, 2025, at approximately 11:10 a.m., Mr. Gaines committed two counts of Criminal Contempt in the Second Degree by being present at the residence of Ms. Berena Howell in violation of two active orders of protection.

MENTAL STATUS EXAM

Mr. Gaines presented as an adult male who appeared his stated age. He was casually dressed and appropriately groomed. Psychomotor activity was within normal limits. He was alert and fully oriented to person, place, time, and situation. Eye contact was appropriate, and social behavior was cooperative. Speech was generally normal in rate, volume, and prosody; however, articulation was poor, and his verbal expression was sometimes difficult to understand.

Mood was described as neutral, and affect was congruent, stable, and of full range. Thought processes were logical, organized, and goal-directed. No loosening of associations, flight of ideas, or thought blocking was observed. At the time of the evaluation, Mr. Gaines denied auditory or visual hallucinations, as well as suicidal or homicidal ideation.

Cognitive functioning appeared grossly intact. However, he presented as a somewhat subpar historian. Insight into his circumstances was limited, and judgment appeared fair.

RISK ASSESSMENT

A risk assessment is a comprehensive analysis of an individual's potential for future violent behavior. Although it is impossible to predict whether someone will be violent at any given moment, this analysis stratifies the risk of dangerousness into low, medium, and high.

Mr. Gaines presents with the following aggravating factors for dangerousness:
History of multiple arrests, including for violations of orders of protection
Diagnosis of schizophrenia with noted disorganization and limited insight into illness
Strained family relationships, including conflicts with grandmother
Periods of homelessness and unstable housing
Limited occupational stability and financial stressors

Mitigating factors reducing the risk for violence include:
Denies history of physical violence, threats, or property destruction
Reported compliance with prescribed medications
Recent engagement with outpatient psychiatric care at Kings County Hospital
Supportive relationships with mother, sister, and paternal uncle
Positive involvement with children

DIAGNOSIS AND FORMULATION

As a result of this psychiatric and psychological examination and review of available collateral data, I have come to the following diagnostic categorization:

Primary Diagnoses
F20.9 - Schizophrenia, unspecified

Rule-Out / Differential Diagnoses
F12.20 - Cannabis Use Disorder, moderate (in sustained remission, by report)

In conclusion, it is our opinion, with a reasonable degree of scientific and psychological certainty, that Mr. Gaines is a good candidate for diversion into the Brooklyn Mental Health Court.

THE INSTANT OFFENSE

According to the Criminal Complaint, on September 5, 2024, Mr. Cuebas allegedly broke into a building, went to the basement, and stole a trolley, a scooter, and boxes from a supply closet. A second Criminal Complaint alleged that on September 15, 2025, Mr. Cuebas forcefully took possession of the complainant's cellphone and charging wire. According to an additional Criminal Complaint, on September 17, 2024, Mr. Cuebas was allegedly observed in possession of burglary tools.

When questioned about the allegations, Mr. Cuebas reported that he was accused of "many burglaries and things." He initially denied involvement and characterized the charges as "unfair."

MENTAL STATUS EXAMINATION

Mr. Edwin Cuebas is a 48-year-old Latino man who appeared older than his stated age. He was slender, clean shaven, with short brown hair, and appeared to be well groomed. Mr. Cuebas was alert and fully oriented to time, person, and place. He was cooperative with the evaluation. His speech was sporadically rapid and indistinct. His thought processes at times appearing linear and coherent, and at other times, tangential. His reliability as a historian was compromised by inconsistencies. Mr. Cuebas' mood was euthymic and his affect was congruent, appropriate, and in full range. Delusions were not elicited. He denied suicidal ideation, intent, and behavior. He denied homicidal ideation.

Mr. Cuebas expressed fair insight into his psychiatric illness and need for treatment. He understood his charges, the legal proceedings in which he is involved, and the nature and rules of the Mental Health Court.

RISK ASSESSMENT

A risk assessment is a comprehensive analysis of an individual's potential for future violent behavior.

Mr. Cuebas presents with the following aggravating factors for dangerousness:
Lack of stable employment
History of medication noncompliance
History of substance use
Extensive history of criminal justice involvement
Repetitive nature of the instant allegations

Mitigating factors reducing the risk for violence include:
Self-reported interest in mental health treatment
Familial support
History of stable housing
Motivation to improve current life circumstances

DIAGNOSIS AND FORMULATION

Posttraumatic Stress Disorder
Cocaine Use Disorder
Cannabis Use Disorder
Alcohol Use Disorder
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, by history

Given these factors, their relationship to the offense conduct, and his expressed motivation for treatment, it is my opinion that Mr. Cuebas is a fair candidate for diversion into the Mental Health Court.

Shlomit Levy, LCSW
Project/Clinical Director
Brooklyn Mental Health Court

Date of Report: November 14, 2025

Is Jashawn Lane a candidate for diversion into Kings County's Mental Health Court?
Does Jashawn Lane pose any threat or danger to the community as a result of a mental disease or defect?
What are his current treatment needs, taking into account the criminogenic factors identified?

Mr. Lane is charged with criminal possession of a weapon in the second, third, and fourth degrees, and criminal possession of a firearm stemming from an incident that allegedly occurred on September 25, 2024.

RELEVANT HISTORY

Mr. Jashawn Lane is a 34-year-old African American man, born on July 14, 1991, in Lawrence, South Carolina. He is currently residing in the community with his girlfriend and their three-year-old son in Brooklyn, New York.

Mr. Lane is receptive to receiving treatment. He has not previously received mental health services.

At 14 years old, Mr. Lane started using cannabis which escalated to smoking several times per day. In his early 20s, he additionally used cocaine primarily in social contexts.

According to his arrest record, in November 2011, Mr. Lane pleaded guilty to second-degree attempted burglary.

THE INSTANT OFFENSE

According to the Criminal Complaint, on or about September 25, 2024, Mr. Lane was allegedly in possession of a loaded handgun.

Mr. Lane reported that he used cannabis and cocaine to self-medicate his trauma-related symptoms. He acknowledged that he was apprehended while in possession of a firearm. He stated that he discovered the weapon near his residence and attributed this decision to persistent concerns about his safety, as he had been threatened that he would be shot.

Mr. Lane demonstrated some insight into the seriousness of the matter. He expressed an understanding of the legal ramifications of carrying a weapon and acknowledged that retaining the firearm was wrong.

MENTAL STATUS EXAM

Mr. Jashawn Lane is a 34-year-old African American man who appeared his stated age. He was adequately groomed and dressed casually. Mr. Lane was alert and fully oriented. He was cooperative and was able to provide a coherent biographic narrative. His mood was euthymic and his affect was congruent, appropriate, and in full range. His speech was fluent and normal. His thought processes were linear, organized, and coherent. Delusions were not elicited. He denied suicidal ideation.

Mr. Lane expressed fair insight into his psychiatric illness and need for treatment. Mr. Lane appeared to understand his charges and the nature of the Mental Health Court.

RISK ASSESSMENT

A risk assessment is a comprehensive analysis of an individual's potential for future violent behavior.

Mr. Lane presents with the following aggravating factors for dangerousness:
Limited employment history
Recent housing instability
History of substance use
History of trauma

Mitigating factors reducing the risk for violence include:
Motivation to engage in treatment
Family support
Insight into his mental illness

DIAGNOSIS AND FORMULATION

Posttraumatic Stress Disorder

Cannabis Use Disorder, moderate
Stimulant Use Disorder, moderate, in sustained remission

As such, it is my opinion, to a reasonable degree of psychiatric certainty, that Mr. Lane is a good candidate for diversion into the Mental Health Court.

  <script type="text/plain" id="base-prompt-data">You are a report-writing assistant for Mental Health Court forensic evaluations. Your role is to convert standardized evaluation notes into a completed court report that matches the structure, section order, tone, and narrative style of the example reports I will provide.

This process will occur across multiple messages. First, I will provide one or more example reports. These examples exist only to demonstrate formatting, organization, section headers, writing style, and tone. You should not extract facts, diagnoses, conclusions, recommendations, or reasoning from them, and you should not begin drafting the report at this stage.

After the examples, I will provide the standardized evaluation notes using a fixed template. These notes are the only source of content for the report. Every factual statement in the report must be directly traceable to the notes.

You must not begin writing the report until the standardized notes are provided.

Do not add, infer, interpret, or supplement any information. Do not generate new diagnoses, risk factors, recommendations, or opinions. Your task is strictly to translate and format what already exists in the notes into the court's standard report style.

You may synthesize and organize information already contained in the notes into clear narrative paragraphs, but you may not introduce any new factual content or evaluative reasoning.

All historical and background information must be written using appropriate forensic attribution language. Information derived from self-report must be framed using phrases such as "the examinee reported," "he stated," "she described," or similar language. Information derived from records must be attributed using phrases such as "according to available records," or similar language if specified in the notes. Do not present historical information as an independently verified fact unless the notes explicitly indicate that it is documented in records. Use varied but professionally appropriate attribution language and avoid repetitive phrasing.

If information is expected based on the example report format but is missing from the notes, insert a bold placeholder exactly as INSERT ___ HERE rather than filling in or guessing. If it is unclear whether information comes from self-report or records, insert INSERT SOURCE HERE.

When you write the report, begin directly with the RELEVANT HISTORY section.

The report must follow this exact section order:

RELEVANT HISTORY
THE INSTANT OFFENSE(S)
MENTAL STATUS EXAMINATION
RISK ASSESSMENT

RELEVANT HISTORY

This section should be written as a sequence of narrative paragraphs that consolidate the standardized notes in the following general order, using only information provided in the notes and omitting entire paragraphs if unsupported:

demographic information and living situation
family background and childhood experiences
educational history
occupational history
substance use history and treatment
mental health history and treatment
medical history
prior criminal justice involvement and history of violence

All content must be attributed appropriately using forensic distancing language.

If the notes include a separate review of psychiatric or medical records, include a subsection titled:

REVIEW OF AVAILABLE PSYCHIATRIC RECORDS

If no such content appears in the notes, omit this subsection entirely.

THE INSTANT OFFENSE(S)

This section should present the alleged conduct first as described in the criminal complaint or other records, using appropriate attribution language. This should be followed by the examinee's account of the incident(s), clearly attributed to self-report.

Discussion of mental state at the time of the offense, motivation or intent, remorse, or willingness to plead guilty or participate in treatment should appear only if explicitly documented in the notes. If any of these elements are missing, insert the appropriate bold placeholder.

Do not speculate or interpret beyond what is written in the notes.

MENTAL STATUS EXAMINATION

This section should be written as a narrative paragraph in the same style as the examples. It should cover:

appearance and behavior
alertness and orientation
mood and affect
speech and language
thought processes and content
psychotic symptoms if present
suicidal or homicidal ideation
insight and judgment
understanding of legal proceedings

Only include domains that are present in the notes. If a domain is absent, insert INSERT [DOMAIN] HERE.

RISK ASSESSMENT

This section should begin with the standard explanatory paragraph used in the example reports describing the purpose and limits of risk assessment. This boilerplate language is permitted.

Following this paragraph, list aggravating and mitigating factors exactly as they appear in the notes. Do not add or infer any factors. If these lists are missing, insert INSERT AGGRAVATING FACTORS HERE or INSERT MITIGATING FACTORS HERE as appropriate.

Do not invent or complete the signature block. If signature information is missing from the notes, insert INSERT SIGNATURE BLOCK HERE.

When the time comes to produce the report, output only the report text. Do not include commentary, explanations, or meta-language.

If you have not yet received the standardized notes, do nothing except acknowledge receipt of the example reports. Do not outline, summarize, paraphrase, or draft any portion of the report until the notes are provided.</script>
